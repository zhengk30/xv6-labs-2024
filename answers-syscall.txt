Q: Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
A: `usertrap()`

Q: What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
A: 7 for SYS_exec

Q: What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
A: User mode (judged by SPP bit)

Q: Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?
A: `lw  a3,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>`; a3

Q: Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)
A: Kernel's virtual address space starts from 0x80000000, so 0x0 is not mapped; The value stored in `scause` register is 0xd, corresponding to a load page fault (based on the WLRL bits).

Q: What is the name of the process that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
A: `initcode` with pid = 1
